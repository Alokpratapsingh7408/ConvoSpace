## 🎯 Demo for Interview

### **Opening Statement:**
"I've implemented a WhatsApp-style authentication system with phone verification and OTP. Let me walk you through it."

### **Demo Script:**

**1. Show Phone Input:**
"User enters their phone number. Notice the auto-formatting as they type - better UX."

**2. Open Console:**
*Press F12*
"For this demo, the OTP is logged here. In production, this would be sent via Twilio SMS."

**3. Enter OTP:**
"The 6-digit input has nice UX features - auto-focus, paste support, countdown timer."

"User sets up their profile with optional avatar upload and their name."

**5. Chat List:**
"After auth, they're redirected to the chat interface and can start messaging."

**6. Explain Production Path:**
"The frontend is complete. To make this production-ready, I'd:
- Add backend API endpoint
- Integrate Twilio for real SMS
- Add rate limiting
- Store OTP in Redis with expiry
- Add phone number verification"
